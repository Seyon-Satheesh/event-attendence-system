# ShowUp - Getting People At Your Events

This is my project for FBLA CNLC's Coding and Programming Event. This is an Event Attendance System that allows Students, Teachers, Office Administrators and Principals to view, create and join upcoming events. Students are incentivized to participate in these events with points that place them in contention of winning school, food and school spirit prizes.
